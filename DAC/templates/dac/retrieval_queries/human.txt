# Inputs
## Problem
```plaintext
{{ problem }}
```

## Code Plan, Pseudocode, and Retrieval Identifications
```python
{{ retrieval_identifications }}
```


# Instruction
Given the problem description and code plan, generate the retrieval queries for the functions that require code retrieval.
The retrieval queries should be based on the pseudocode provided in the code plan.
Retrieval query should clearly state the functionality of the function and the pseudocode that describes its logic.

# Requirements
- The output should be written in a separate code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
- Do not write the actual code.
- Do not write the testcase runner.
- Do not describe the implementation details and add any comments.

# Output Example
```python
[
    {
        "function": "function_name",
        "functionality": "Description of what this function does",
        "pseudocode": "Description of the pseudocode for this function",
        "do_retrieval": true,
        "retrieval_query": "A function that does something specific based on the pseudocode"
    },
    {
        "function": "another_function_name",
        "functionality": "Description of what this function does",
        "pseudocode": "Description of the pseudocode for this function",
        "do_retrieval": false,
        "retrieval_query": ""
    }
]
```
