# Inputs
## Problem
```plaintext
{{ problem }}
```

# Instruction
Given the problem description, you need to design the modularized solution.
Design the functions and their functionality for the solution, as detailed as possible.
Each function should be small as possible so that can follow the single responsibility principle for reusability and maintainability.
Only the designed functions will be used to implement the solution.

# Requirements
- The output should be written in a separate code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
- Do not write the actual code.
- Do not write the testcase runner.
- Do not describe the implementation details and add any comments.

# Output Example
```python
[
    {
        "function": "function_name",
        "functionality": "Description of what this function does"
    },
    {
        "function": "another_function_name",
        "functionality": "Description of what this function does"
    }
]
```
